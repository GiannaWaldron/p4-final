<h2>This webpage is a site that children can learn and interact with. I have a two year old niece who is better at using technology than some adults I know. 
    Children today grow up around technology. Keeping that concept in mind a created a learning tool for children. 
    Here they can have a better understanding of the function of a computer as well as further their vocabulary. </h2>
